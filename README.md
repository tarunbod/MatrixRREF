## What
A GUI that allows you to enter in decimal values for the entries of an m by n matrix and then displays the rref form. Also prints out the step by step calculation (in LaTeX format!) in the console.

## Why
I took linear algebra during the Spring 2019 semester, and our weekly homework assignments could be written in LaTeX. Matrix RREF is a common calculation throughout the course, and I didn't feel like typing out the steps of the algorithm every week. Hence this program.
